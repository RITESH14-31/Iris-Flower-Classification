# Iris-Flower-Classification

The Iris flower classification is a well-known dataset used in machine learning for supervised learning classification tasks. The dataset contains measurements of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers - Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

The dataset consists of 150 observations, with 50 samples for each of the three species. The goal of the classification task is to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements.

The Iris flower classification dataset is often used as a benchmark dataset for evaluating classification algorithms, and has been used in many machine learning and statistical learning textbooks as an example dataset.

Overall, the Iris flower classification is a classic example of a classification problem in machine learning, and is widely used in academic research and industry applications.
